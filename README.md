# Three-LevelContextOntology
Implementation of the work "Consolidating a Three-Level Ontology for Context Modelling"
Abstract. Context modelling is one of the stages during the context life cycle. It has the 
aim of giving meaning and structure to the collected contextâ€™s raw data. Although there are 
different context models proposed in the literature, we have identified some gaps that are not 
fully covered, particularly related to the reusa-bility of the models themselves and the lack 
of consolidated and standardized ontological resources. To tackle this problem, we adopt a three-layered 
context ontology approach and we focus on this paper in the middle-level. We show the process we have 
followed to propose this ontology. We show a preliminary evaluation of the ontology illustrating some 
possible scenario for which we de-rive a lower-level, domain-dependent ontology from the middle-level proposal.
